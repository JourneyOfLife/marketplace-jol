# The Journey Of Life (JOL) Marketplace Platform License

### **A Message of Openness, Trust, and Shared Mission**

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in the Journey of Life (JOL) Marketplace. This document explains the legal framework that governs the use of our platform's software. We have chosen this license not just for legal reasons, but to actively protect our shared values and ensure this platform remains a permanent, ethical, and community-owned resource for all ecclesiastical communities across Europe.

---

### **üìú In Simple Terms: Our Promise to You**

We believe the tools that serve the faithful should be built *by* and *for* the community, transparent in their operation, and free from hidden exploitation. Therefore, the JOL platform software is **Free and Open Source**.

This means:

*   **You are free to use it:** Any church, diocese, parish, funeral home, or certified seller can use this platform to buy or sell goods at no cost for the software itself.
*   **You are free to study it:** You can see how the software works. We have nothing to hide. This builds trust.
*   **You are free to improve it:** Technically-minded members of your community can suggest improvements or fix issues for the benefit of all.
*   **You are free to share it:** You can install and run your own instance of the platform.

### **üõ°Ô∏è The Core Principle: "Share Alike"**

Our chosen license is the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**. It is considered one of the most protective and virtuous licenses in the open-source world. It is built on one fundamental principle:

**If you modify the platform's software and then run it as a service for others (e.g., you create a new feature for your national church and host it), you must publicly share the source code of your modifications with the community.**

*   **Why we chose this:** This prevents any single entity from taking this community project, adding proprietary improvements, and selling it back to the wider church community without contributing those improvements back. It ensures that every improvement benefits everyone, strengthening the entire Body of Christ and all people of faith.
*   **What it means for most users:** If you are simply **using** the JOL Marketplace as a buyer, seller, or administrator, this clause does not affect you. Your data and your operations remain your own. This obligation only applies if you are a **developer or organization hosting a modified version** of the software.

### **üë• Who This License Protects**

This license is intelligently designed to be the best fit for our diverse European community:

*   **For Catholic & Protestant Churches, Orthodox Parishes (ROC, Romanian, etc.), and Dioceses:** Use the platform with the confidence that it is built on a foundation of ethical collaboration, not proprietary lock-in. It will always serve your mission, not a shareholder's interest.
*   **For Funeral Homes, Cemetery, and Bereavement Services:** Participate in a trusted network. The openness of the platform guarantees you are on a stable, community-vetted system that won't suddenly change its fees or rules.
*   **For Sellers (Manufacturers, Distributors):** Your business is built on trust. This platform's open nature means the rules of the marketplace are transparent and fair. You cannot be unfairly disadvantaged by hidden algorithms.
*   **For Developers and IT Professionals in Religious Institutions:** You have the freedom to audit the code for security, ensure compliance with data privacy laws (like GDPR), and customize the platform to your specific needs, knowing that your work will be respected and shared for the common good.
*   **For Students and Academics:** Study, learn from, and contribute to a real-world, large-scale software project that serves a profound humanitarian and spiritual purpose.

### **‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**Q: Does this mean our parish data is public?**
**A:** Absolutely not. The *software* is open source. Your data‚Äîproduct listings, orders, personal information‚Äîis yours alone and is governed by our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, which are fully compliant with GDPR.

**Q: Our diocese has developers. Can we host our own version?**
**A:** Yes! We encourage it. You can host your own instance tailored to your specific needs. If your developers make changes to the *software itself*, the license requires them to share those changes back to the public project, so the entire community may benefit.

**Q: Is it really free?**
**A:** The software is free. Hosting, support, and custom integration services may have associated costs, just as a freely given Bible may be printed in a book that has a cost.

**For any other questions regarding the license, please consult your legal advisor.**
